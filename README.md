# FrankenPHP and Laravel 13 Octane with Docker

This template was created for a quick start of a Laravel project with already
prepared basic logic and is required by the environment:

<a href="https://github.com/deniskorbakov/laravel-13-frankenphp-docker"><img alt="" src="https://github.com/deniskorbakov/laravel-13-frankenphp-docker/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg">
</a>

## Installation

To start the template you will need git and docker/docker compose

**Performing steps:**

You can also submit a template to yourself through the GitHub interface

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deniskorbakov/laravel-13-frankenphp-docker.git
```

Let's go to the cloned repository

```bash
cd laravel-13-frankenphp-docker
```

Copy env example to env

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Let's run the command to start the project

```bash
make init
```

---

## If you need to run a regular php server

> You may need this when working with filament or just for testing locally

Then this command will launch a regular artisan server

```bash
make build-simple
```

The server will be accessible by `localhot:8000`

if you want to communicate without a port, then change `APP_PORT` on 80 port
